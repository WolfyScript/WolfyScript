### Hi my name is Gunnar,
I'm a Java Developer and Computer Science Student.  
I first started working on Minecraft projects in 2015.  
Since then I develop Minecraft Plugins and Mods in my free-time.  
Most of the projects I work on are Minecraft server plugins based on Spigot and recently started working with Sponge.
