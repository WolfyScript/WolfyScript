### Hi my name is Gunnar,
I'm a Java Developer and Computer Science Student.  
I first started working on Minecraft projects in 2015.  
Since then I develop Minecraft Plugins and Mods in my free-time.  
Most of the projects I work on are Minecraft server plugins based on Spigot and recently started working Sponge.

:gear: Iâ€™m currently working on Spigot plugins, designed to extend the customizability of Minecraft and make content creation easier.
For example custom Items, Recipes and APIs that combine common code of my projects.

:book: I'm currently studying Computer Science and learning new ways to optimize my projects.
