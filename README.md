### Hi my name is Gunnar,
I'm a Java Developer and I first started working on Minecraft related projects in 2015.  
Since then I learned a lot about making plugins and I am passionate about developing quality Plugins in my free-time.  
I mostly work on Minecraft server plugins based on Spigot.
_______

:gear: Iâ€™m currently working on Spigot plugins, which are focused on making content creation for servers easier.  
Like Items, Recipes, APIs or even Armor Stand customization.

:book: Always learning new ways to improve my projects and workflow.
